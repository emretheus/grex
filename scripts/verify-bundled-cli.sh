# ----- Bundled binary architecture check -----------------------------------
# grex-cli is built per-arch via cargo --target, so its lipo arch is the
# source of truth for what this bundle is targeting. Every other bundled
# executable must match — otherwise an x64 .dmg ends up shipping an arm64
# binary and Intel users see "bad CPU type in executable" (#293).
#
# This includes grex-sidecar: it's a Bun `--compile` artifact built in
# sidecar/scripts/build.ts, which historically ignored the target triple and
# emitted a host-arch binary. The CLI/vendor checks below did NOT cover it, so
# an arm64 sidecar shipped in the x86_64 release. Keep it first in the list.
