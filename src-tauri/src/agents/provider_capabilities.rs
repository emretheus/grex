//! Provider capability contract.
//!
//! Encodes "does this provider support feature X?" as data instead of
//! `provider == "codex"` checks scattered across the codebase. The
//! frontend and the streaming layer both read off the same shape so
//! adding a new provider (Copilot/ACP via #511, Pi via #321, …) is a
//! single edit here plus a row in the test matrix below.
//!
//! Permission is modeled as a binary: a turn either runs in `plan`
//! (read-only) mode or with full access. `supports_plan_mode` is the
//! only flag the composer needs — it gates the Plan toggle.
