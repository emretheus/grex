//! Runtime process registry — tracks every PTY-backed script /
//! terminal Grex spawns so a crash recovery sweep can identify
//! stale processes on the next launch.
//!
//! Design goals (conservative-on-purpose):
//!
//! - **Record on spawn, mark ended on exit.** `record_started` writes
//!   a row when the child is registered with `ScriptProcessManager`;
//!   `record_ended` stamps `ended_at` once the manager's owner thread
//!   reaps the child (whether via natural exit, user-initiated kill,
//!   or the graceful-quit `kill_all`).
//! - **No auto-kill on startup.** [`classify_stale_processes`] looks
//!   at rows whose `ended_at` is still NULL after an app restart and
//!   classifies them as either "definitely dead" (PID returns ESRCH;
//!   we mark them ended) or "maybe alive" (PID still answers signal-0
//!   poll; we surface the row but leave the process untouched). PIDs
//!   can be reused by the OS, so blindly killing a "maybe alive"
//!   process would risk hitting an unrelated user process.
//! - **No "kill by port".** Out of scope; the registry is the
//!   identity-based pathway. Killing by listening port is rejected by
//!   the contribution plan because it can't prove ownership.
//!
//! Today the registry is a startup diagnostic only — it logs what it
//! finds. A later UI slice can decide whether to surface the "maybe
//! alive" rows to the user; the data is already here.
