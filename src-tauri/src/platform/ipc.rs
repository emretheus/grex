//! Cross-platform local IPC socket for Codewit's single-instance UI-sync channel.
//!
//! A running Codewit instance binds an `AF_UNIX` stream socket under the app's
//! run directory; a second invocation (e.g. opening a deep link) connects to it
//! to hand off the event instead of starting a duplicate window. `AF_UNIX` is
//! native on Unix and on Windows 10 1803+ (exposed here via `uds_windows`), so
//! the same filesystem-path-addressed socket works on every desktop target.
